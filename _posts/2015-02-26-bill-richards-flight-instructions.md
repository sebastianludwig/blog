A few days ago a friend recommended two entertaining and intersting articles

1. [Why animals eat psychoactive plants](http://boingboing.net/2015/01/20/why-animals-eat-psychoactive-p.html)
1. [The Trip Treatment](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment)

The second one mentions 

> “flight instructions” prepared by Bill Richards

I was hooked and wanted to follow up, but these flight instructions weren't easy to find. The first clue was that [Bill's name is actually William](http://www.bpru.org/cancer-studies/about-usBill.html). And second, the document's title isn't actually "flight instructions". But [a list of his publications](https://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/richards_bill/richards_bill.shtml) contains _"Navigation within Consciousness: Insights from Four Decades of Psychotherapy Research with Imagery, Music and Entheogens"_. And, sure enough, here you go:
