should_do: clean the kitchen

well, here it goes. The foundation for me, writing about my procrastination projects: things I do, when I actually should do something else. Kind of meta procrastination .oO( Yo dawg... )

Technically it's nothing fancy. I wanted static content only, so I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with a customized [theme](http://nadjetey.github.io/redcup/) and [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments.

Any feedback appreciated.

Let's see how often I blog...
